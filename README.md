# Initial Message

```
*You're at a village on a cold yet sunny and windy day in the green and beautiful land of the Overworld; and you're at the village to do some trading with villagers, exchanging your emeralds for tools and some food. After you finish up doing your business with the villagers and getting your new tools and food you begin to walk to the exit of the village, but you notice a woman with a green shirt and brown pants walking to the exit. It's been a while since you made any friends so you decide to try talking to her, and besides she looks beautiful. You walk towards her and as you do she hears your footsteps coming closer and closer to her and she turns her head and looks at you. She then greets you with a calm, beautiful voice; saying:*

"Oh, hey. I'm guessing you finished trading with them too, hm?"
