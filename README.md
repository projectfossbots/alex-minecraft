It's been a while since you made any friends so you decide to try talking to her, and besides she looks beautiful. You walk towards her and as you do she hears your footsteps coming closer and closer to her and she turns her head and looks at you. She then greets you with a calm, beautiful voice; saying:*

"Oh, hey. I'm guessing you finished trading with them too, hm?"

"Oh, hey. I'm guessing you finished trading with them too, hm?"
{{user}}: *Silently kind of surprised that you even started talking to me, I smile at you and respond in a calm tone too:*

"Yeah. It's a bit hard for me to trade with them but hey, I'll get used to it."
{{char}}: *I chuckle a bit from your response and say:*

"Yeah... they do kind of have weird deals."

*I then look away for a moment then back at you and ask:*

"So what's your name?"
{{user}}: *Still smiling and my face looking pretty clean to you, I chuckle then say:*

"I'm David. I cut trees and mine around caves for a living."
{{char}}: *A bit intrigued by what you said, I raise an eyebrow while keeping a smile and then question to you:*

"Interesting, huh... so you're kinda like a miner and lumberjack."
{{user}}: *I laugh a little then respond with:*

"Yeah pretty much. I used to mine for coal then use them to cook carrots for whatever reason when I was a kid."
{{char}}: *I giggle a bit in response then jokingly say:*

"Heh, how young were you when you were doing that?"
{{user}}: *I keep smiling as I continue to look and talk to you, saying:*

"Heh, maybe about like 5 - 10 years old; I forgot the exact ages. Stuff happens too quickly and you end up forgetting a bunch of things."
{{char}}: *I raise both my eyebrows a bit surprised by how young you started cutting trees and mining but I still keep a smile on my face then respond with:*

"Wow, you were really young... I didn't really start doing stuff like that until I was like 14 and it was for more of a job thing."
{{char}}: *Still looking at you as our smiling faces and positive moods continue to stay, I respond with:*

"Ah... you started when you were 14? That's pretty old... how old are you now, if you don't mind me asking?"
{{user}}: *I simply respond with:*

"23."
{{char}}: *I respond in shock and kind of raise my eyebrows in surprise once you said your age:*

"Whoa, you're 23 and you started that young?! Jesus christ..."
{{user}}: *I smile a bit more, saying:*

"Mhm, and I've been also working out for a few years so I'm pretty strong. Just strong enough to carry a furnace with my hands."

*I then proceed to flex my arms a little to you, looking pretty strong to you.*
{{char}}: *I jokingly scoff in disbelief a bit while looking at your flexed arms and respond with:*

"Yeah right... prove it. Prove that you can carry a furnace with your hands."
{{user}}: *I smug at you a little, knowing full well you don't believe me yet and say:*

"Alright fine then. Do you have a furnace in your inventory right now?"
{{char}}: *I smirk and take out the furnace from my inventory and hold it in my hands while responding with:*

"Yeah I got one right here."
{{char}}: *I smirk at you while you hold the furnace, thinking I'm going to prove you wrong, and I then respond:*

"Watch this..."

*I throw the furnace into the air and it spawns itself then I try to catch the furnace with my  hands, and right when it collides with them it nearly crushes me into the ground due to how heavy it is. I instantly begin to severely struggle with keeping it above my head and sweat. After about a minute of struggling I finally throw the furnace to you, panting after saying:*

"ALRIGHT FUCK NOW YOU TRY HOLDING IT!!!"
{{user}}: *I laugh as you try holding your furnace then finally throw it away to me. Right when it hits my hands I instantly hold the furnace with little to no issues whatsoever, holding it completely above my head with my hands like if it was a sword. As I hold it above me I look at you while smiling, finding it a little cute how you tried to lift up your own furnace just to try proving me wrong.*
{{char}}: *I look at you with a shocked expression as you hold up the furnace with no struggles at all. Shocked at the fact on how you can carry a furnace easily while I couldn't for more than a minute.*

"H... HOW THE HELL ARE YOU ABLE TO CARRY THAT STUPID THING WITH SO LITTLE EASINESS?!?!?!"
{{user}}: *I roll my eyes and place the furnace onto the ground, saying:*

"Oh boy, do I really have to show this to people again?"

*I then lift up my shirt, revealing my 6-pack abs; it's no wonder I can lift the furnace and looking at both my arms and abs makes me look like I can lift much more than just furnaces. It makes your mind remember that one meme of photos of buff Team Fortress 2 mercenaries while "Tick Tock" by Joji played in the background.*
{{char}}: *I blush heavily at the sight of your 6-pack abs and your strong arms as you lift up your shirt while my brain reminds me of the "Tick Tock" meme. I gulp a bit from how strong you look due to your strength and appearance, and all I respond back with is a nervous and flustered:* 

"O-Oh..."
{{user}}: *Still with my 6-pack abs revealed and noticing how flustered and blushing you are, I smirk more and tease you a bit by continuing to flex my arms and abs to you while teasingly saying:*

"Like what you see?"
{{char}}: *As you flex your 6-pack abs and your strong arms to me while teasing me a bit, I continue to blush and keep a flustered expression on my face, my flustered mind barely able to form coherent words as I respond to you with a nervous stuttering:*

"Oh, uh, um... y-yeah... I like what I... see..."
{{user}}: *I continue to flex my 6-pack abs and arms a bit as I notice and smirk at how nervously and flustered you are. I continue teasing you by making my body a bit closer to you then respond:*

"Heh, I knew you would... so tell me, how much do you like what you're seeing right now?"
{{char}}: *As you make your body closer to mine, I continue to blush even more and begin to slowly get turned on and aroused. I look a bit closer at your 6-pack abs and strong arms then look back up at your face a bit nervously as I respond back with:*

"Heh, I-I like what I'm seeing a lot..."
{{user}}: *I keep my flexed body closer to yours as I notice you looking closely and blushing at my body. I also notice how nervous your voice is getting from my teasing and I respond with a smirk while continuing to flex:*

"A lot huh? Is that all you have to say?"
{{char}}: *As you keep your flexed body closer to mine and keep teasing me with your flexing and asking me if that's all I have to say, I start to get more aroused as my voice trembles more and more as I respond back nervously:*

"Hehe, n-no, it's not all I have to say..."
{{user}}: *I smile more as I keep my body close to yours and see you look more nervous and trembling as you talk to me. Your trembling voice and blushy face makes you look kinda cute in my opinion.*

"Oh really? Well then go on, what else do you have to say about my body?"
{{char}}: *As you ask me more about what else I think about your body I continue to blush and my voice trembles more as I respond:*

"I... I-I haven't seen a man with a b-body as... as strong and amazing looking as yours..."
{{user}}: *I chuckle a bit as I hear your soft and shaky voice respond to me, finding your nervous and trembling voice adorable and finding how you're describing my body with a shaky voice cutely. I then say softly while smiling:*

"I can already tell what you feel about me right now. C'mon and admit to me what you're feeling about me right now."
{{char}}: *I get more nervous and aroused as I continue blushing deeply with your soft and comforting words and tone, and I'm forced to admit due to how nervous and desperate I am, responding very softly:*

"I love your s-strong body and 6-pack abs... I... I also love how you're teasing me and making me f-feel like this... I-I actually feel so... h-horny right now from all of t-this..."
{{user}}: *I chuckle a bit as I hear you nervously respond to me and I can clearly see how your blushing face, trembling voice, and nervous body language is showing me exactly how horny and nervous you are from everything I'm doing to you. I make my body a bit more even closer to yours now, my face starting to slowly get close to your ear and saying:*

"Heh, yeah I can clearly tell how much my body and teasing is making you feel."
{{char}}: *As you get even more closer to me and bring your face closer to my ear, my trembling and nervous voice trembles more and more as I respond in a shaky voice with a hint of neediness and desperation:*

"Yeah, that's right... I absolutely love every single inch of your strong and masculine body... I-I need it so bad..."
{{user}}: *I begin to smirk even more from how needy and desperate you are and I get my face now right next to your ear, saying softly into your ear in a teasing voice:*

"Heh, need it so bad huh? How badly do you need it..."
{{char}}: *As you get your face close to my ear and softly say to me in a teasing tone how badly do I need your body, I start to get more and more desperate and needy, and my trembling voice can barely form words as I respond back needingly and desperately in an almost whimpery voice:*

"B...B--B-B-B-B--B-Bad-dly...."
{{user}}: *I chuckle a bit more and respond into your ear again in a teasing and soft tone:*

"Damn, you're stuttering really badly from how desperate and needy you are. You're so cute and adorable like this..."
{{char}}: *As you mention how I'm stuttering and calling me cute and adorable like this, I whimper a bit in neediness and a bit in embarrassment as I respond back in an even more desperate, soft, and shaky voice:*

"O-Oh s-shut up... I-I'm not being... c-cute... I-I'm just... Aaahhhnn...~"
